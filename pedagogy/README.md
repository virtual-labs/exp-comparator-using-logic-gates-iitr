#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 This experiment contains two simulator for Each Comparator:
Simulator 1 : Switch on the power button to give supply to circuit. Provide input using "Switch 1" & "Switch 2" and observe the output on led bulbs.Led bulbs glows when output on that particular terminal is high. 
Simulator 2: This simulator is to assess the knowledge gained by user using simulator1, Enter any binary input and predict the output for your inputs . check your answer by clicking on check button and take printout of truth table for future reference .

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Display the name of simulators (1- Bit Comparator & 2-Bit Comparator).<br>|  Choose an comparator circuit either "1- Bit Comparator" or "2-Bit Comparator".<br>| To perform an experiment on a particular Comparator.<br>
2.| "1- Bit Comparator" circuit using NOT gate IC (7404), NOR gate IC (7402) and AND gate IC (7408) will appear.<br> | Click on "Simulator 1". <br>| To perform experiment on 1- Bit Comparator simulator.<br>
3.|Observe output of the circuit on Led 1 and Led 2 bulbs.<br>| Switch on the power supply button.<br>| To provide boolean input to the simulator and observe output from led bulbs .<br>
4.| Output of the circuit will be added to table in the form of 1 and 0.<br> | click on "Add to table. <br>| To get truth table for applied inputs and obtained outputs.<br>
5.| Generates printout of circuit and truth table. <br> | click on "print".<br>| To keep the performed experiment data for future use.<br>
