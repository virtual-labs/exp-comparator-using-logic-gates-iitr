<b> Experiment|     <b> 12. Verify the truth table of one bit and two bit comparator using logic gates.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5> <br>

This experiment is to analyse the truth table of 1-bit comparator by using NOT, AND and NOR logic gate ICs and 2-bit comparator by using 1-input NOT, 3-input AND, 2-input AND, 3-input OR and 2-input Ex-NOR logic gate ICs and to understand the working of 1-bit comparator and 2- bit comparator with the help of LEDs display.
